# ChatBot
Project based on the tutorial given my NeuralNine in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lwddP0KUEg

The idea behind this project is to create a chatbot using python, with the help of neural networks and natural language processing. It is rather basic but does have a decent understanding of preexisting topics. 
Used packages such as tensorflow and NLTK to create the different layers of the neural network and add different concepts of language processing, respectively.

Honestly was just a quite project to get a more hands on understanding of how a chatbot works and how NLTK is used!
